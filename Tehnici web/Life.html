<h3>General informations</h2>
<p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear[a]) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which comprise the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.
Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.
Koalas were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia. Koalas are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Australian government similarly lists specific populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable. The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. Sanctuaries were established, and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. The biggest threat to their existence is habitat destruction caused by agriculture and urbanisation.</p>

<h3>Day to day life</h3>
<p>Koala babies are called joeys. A newborn joey looks just like a pink jellybean! It's about 2 centimetres long, has no fur and its eyes and ears are not yet fully formed. Koala joeys are born without fur, and with their eyes and ears not yet fully developed. This joey is about 2 to 3 months old.
Amazingly, the tiny joey makes its way from the birth canal to the pouch without any help from its mother, climbing up through the fur on her abdomen to the pouch opening. Once inside, it attaches itself to one of the two milk teats which swells to fill its mouth.
The joey stays inside the pouch for the first few months of its life and drinks only mother’s milk. Slowly it grows, developing eyes, ears and fur.
From about 5 or 6 months, the joey pops its head outside the pouch and feeds upon a special food called ‘pap’.
Pap is a soft and runny form of the mother’s droppings which allows the mother to pass on to the joey special tiny organisms which are necessary for the digestion of gum leaves.
By about 7 months of age, the joey leaves the pouch for longer and longer periods of time and it rides on its mother’s abdomen or back, gradually getting used to the diet of gum leaves, although it still returns to the pouch to drink milk until it is too big to fit inside.
The young Koala leaves its mother to take care of itself sometime between 1 and 2 years of age, usually when the mother’s next joey comes out of the pouch. It will need to find some forest that is not occupied by another Koala in order to set up its own home range. Koalas are fully grown by their third or fourth year.
The breeding season runs from about August to March and this is a time when Koalas are very active. Females start breeding at about 3 or 4 years of age. They usually have one joey each year, but not all females breed each year. Some produce joeys only every two or three years.
In good habitat in the wild, male Koalas live for about 10 years, while females may live a few years longer. However, Koalas in suburban areas might only survive for a few weeks, months or years, because of the dangers of having to contend with cars and dogs, and of having to live in damaged habitat.</p>
